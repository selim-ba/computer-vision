# Computer Vision Projects

This repo showcases my journey through key areas of computer vision. Each project includes annotated code and, and a detailed article.

## Work in Progress
- Style Transfer with Pix2Pix and CycleGAN  
- Object Detection and Image Segmentation with Mask R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and YOLO models  
- Some work with U-Net, VAE  
- Some work with Vision Transformers
