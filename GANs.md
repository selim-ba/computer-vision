# Generative Adversarial Networks

In this article, we will see how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [1]  work, and how we can use them to generate realistic images.

# 1 - Intro to Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced by Ian Goodfellow (2014) as $a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which two modelsÂ , discriminator and generator, are trained simultaneously.$
